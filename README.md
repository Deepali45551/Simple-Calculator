# Simple-Calculator
This repository contains a basic console-based calculator program implemented in C++. The calculator allows users to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting two numbers and selecting an operation, ensuring error handling for division by zero. The code is well-documented and serves as a helpful starting point for those learning C++ or looking to build upon a fundamental calculator application.

Features:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Input validation to handle non-numeric inputs and prevent division by zero.
A simple, easy-to-understand C++ codebase suitable for beginners.
A clear user interface for a seamless user experience.
